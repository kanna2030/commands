Commands we learned
git init to initialize
git status to check and found that it is in untracked level
git add commands.txt  - to bring it to the staged level
git commit -m "add commands" - to commit the file
git log - to check the HASH id
git restore - to restore the deleted file
git rm --cached - to bring back the file from staged to the untracked level
git log --oneline - to bring the hash ids only
git log --oneline --pretty - to bring the small hash ids
git config --global user.name "craoit"  - so instead of seeing a bigger name in author you will have your own username of git
git config --global user.email "craoit2095@gmail.com" - same goes with email

new branch command(dev): I have added the same commands when i was in dev branch but currently i am in master branch and just to differentiate i have mentioned this statement :

git checkout -b dev
git checkout -b dev - to change the branch
now run git status to chck the branch will show as HEad- dev, master

edit the commands.tt and save it
you will see the branch as dev when you run the git log after committing the file
now change the branch back to the master by running - git checkout master
when you do git log you will not see the file committed at the time of dev branch
that means the different branch has different actions so whatever changes you will make in dev branch it will not affect the master branch


new branch command(dev): I have added the same commands when i was in dev branch but currently i am in master branch and just to differentiate i have mentioned this statement :

git checkout -b dev
git checkout master
git branch
git clone <url>
git remote -v - to check the origin of the repository fetch and push

new line to eecute pull, fetch, push command to sync the repository from guthub to local
git pull origin main

a. git remote set-url --add origin https:<token>@<url from running git remote -v>
b. git push origin main

also run > git remote set-url --delete <url>

also delete the origin url for fetch and push that was originally generated by running git remote -v
so the command is > git remote set-url --delete <url>


Note:
step:
a. first of all you n eed permissions to add something on the github repo
b. you cannot get creds of the github user not ethical way to get authenticated
c. got to github > settings under profile > tokens classic > generate token and copy
d. now go to the local folder
e. run 1st command i.e git remote set-url --add origin https://<token>@<url that you got from running git remote -v>
f. 2nd command i.e git push origin main

Now your data is synced from local to the github repo
