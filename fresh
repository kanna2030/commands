Commands we learned
git init to initialize
git status to check and found that it is in untracked level
git add commands.txt  - to bring it to the staged level
git commit -m "add commands" - to commit the file
git log - to check the HASH id
git restore - to restore the deleted file
git rm --cached - to bring back the file from staged to the untracked level
git log --oneline - to bring the hash ids only
git log --oneline --pretty - to bring the small hash ids
git config --global user.name "craoit"  - so instead of seeing a bigger name in author you will have your own username of git
git config --global user.email "craoit2095@gmail.com" - same goes with email
